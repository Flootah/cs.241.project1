# CS 241 Project #1

## Description:
Write a program in java which reads a sequence of integer values from input- values should be
separated by space. This program should:
 * Build a binary search tree using these values in the order they are entered.
 * Print it in 3 traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order.
 * Allow the user to Add or Remove a value. Once a new tree is generated, print it in inorder
traversal

### Note:
 * Recursion is used in the implementation of the add and remove methods.
 * Duplicates are NOT allowed in this BST. At the very first step after obtaining initial
values check for duplicated values. In case of any duplication asks user to enter values
again.

## To run this programs.jar file:
 * Open a command prompt 				[Win + R, type cmd.exe, press enter]
 * Navigate to the location of the proj1.jar file 	[chdir C://Location/Pf/Program/]
 * Type "java -jar proj1.jar
 * The program should now be running from your command prompt.

Alternatively, you can import the source code into your IDE of choice, then run BinarySearchTree.java.
